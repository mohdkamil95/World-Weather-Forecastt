    <h1 class="w3-center">Safety tips for drivering safely during rain</h1>
    <br>
    <h4>Number 1. Think</h4>
    <p class="w3-text-black"> "Many people drive subconsciously, out of habit," says World Weather Forecast. "And when it rains, they often don't adjust
      their thinking." When conditions are less than ideal, drivers need to stay alert and focused on what's going on around
      them.</p>
    <br>

    <h4>Number 2. Turn on those headlights</h4>
    <p class="w3-text-black">It's the law in all states to turn on headlights when visibility is low, and many states also require having the headlights
      on when the windshield wipers are in use. Praeter says that well-working wipers and relatively new (not threadbare)
      tires also are must-haves when driving in rain.</p>
    <br>

    <h4>Number 3. Beware of hydroplaning </h4>
    <p class="w3-text-black">That's the technical term for what occurs when your tires are getting more traction on the layer of water on the road
      than on the road itselfâ€”the result is that your car begins to slide uncontrollably. It's easy enough to hydroplane:
      All you need is one-twelfth of an inch of rain on the road and a speed of more than 35 miles per hour. If you start
      to hydroplane, let off the accelerator slowly and steer straight until you regain control.</p>
    <br>

    <h4>Number 4. Turn off cruise control </h4>
    <p class="w3-text-black">Ironically, on rain- or snow- slick surfaces, cruise control may cause you to lose control. You might think it'll help
      you stay at one steady speed, but if you hydroplane while you're in cruise control, your car will actually go faster.</p>
    <br>

    <h4>Number 5. Slow down</h4>
    <p class="w3-text-black">"Speed limit signs are designed for ideal conditions, says World Weather Forecast, 'and that means driving when you have
      little traffic and good visibility." That's hardly the environment you're driving in when it's raining, so let up on
      the accelerator and allow more time to get to your destination.</p>
